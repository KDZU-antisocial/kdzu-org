## Found Object #002

August 20th, 2025. A worn brown leather wallet sitting conspicuously in the middle of the sidewalk on 7th Street, just west of MacArthur Park.

Empty. No identification. No credit cards. No cash.

Just a single piece of graph paper, folded into eighths, tucked into the billfold compartment.

## The Diagram

When unfolded, the graph paper revealed a hand-drawn diagram. Not a map exactly, but something more schematic. A series of interconnected nodes, labeled with what appear to be times and dates.

Some nodes are circled. Some have X marks. Lines connect them in patterns we're still trying to understand.

At the bottom, in small, precise handwriting:

> "The network persists. Look for the signals. They are everywhere."

## Interpretation

We believe this is a temporal mapâ€”not of space, but of time. Each node might represent a moment when a transmission occurs, when an object is placed, when a signal can be received.

We're cross-referencing the dates and times with other objects we've found. Patterns are emerging.

## Status

**Analysis In Progress** - We're comparing this diagram to our growing archive of found objects.

If you find a wallet on the ground, open it.
