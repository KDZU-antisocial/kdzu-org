## Found Object #002

August 20th, 2025. A minimal dark blue wallet sitting conspicuously in the middle of the sidewalk on 7th Street, just west of MacArthur Park.

Empty. No identification. No credit cards. No cash.

Just a single piece of graph paper, folded into eighths, tucked into the billfold compartment.

## The Diagram

When unfolded, the graph paper reveals a hand-drawn diagram. Not a map exactly, but something more schematic. A series of interconnected nodes, labeled with what appear to be times and dates.

Some nodes are circled. Some have X marks. Lines connect them in patterns we're still trying to understand.

At the bottom, in small, precise handwriting:

> "The network persists. Look for the signal. All Is Not Lost"
