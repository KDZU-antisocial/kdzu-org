## Found Object #001

On September 12th, 2025, at approximately 2:47 PM, we discovered a single red mitten, turned inside-out, carefully threaded through a chain-link fence at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Alvarado Street in Echo Park.

Most people would walk past this. Just another lost item. Someone's carelessness made visible.

But we stopped. We looked closer.

## The Transmission

Inside the mitten, written in permanent marker on the fabric lining:

```
FM 89.3
11:00 PM PST
34.0736° N, 118.2606° W
```

A frequency. A time. Coordinates that point to a location in Silver Lake, less than two miles away.

## What We Did

We tuned in at the specified time. Static. White noise. Then, at 11:03 PM, a brief burst of what sounded like morse code. We're still working to decode it.

The coordinates led us to a residential street corner. Nothing obvious. A fire hydrant. A storm drain. A faded "No Parking" sign.

We're watching.

## Status

**Active Signal** - We continue to monitor FM 89.3 nightly at 11:00 PM PST.

If you find a mitten, look inside.
