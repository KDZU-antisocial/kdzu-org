## Found Object #003

October 1st, 2025. A paperback copy of sItalo Calvino's *Invisible Citie* sitting on a bus bench on York Boulevard in Highland Park.

Rain-damaged. Sun-bleached spine. Pages swollen from moisture and dried again, making the book permanently thick and warped.

It appeared to be trash. A discarded book that someone had finished and abandoned.

But we picked it up anyway.

## The Code

Throughout the book, seemingly random words are underlined in pencil. Light marks, easily missed. We almost missed them.

We extracted the underlined words in order of appearance:

> "listen tuesday midnight arroyo beneath bridge third pillar west side"

A complete sentence. An instruction. A location.

## The Meeting Point

The Arroyo Seco. We know it well from our MDC research. The underlined words specify Tuesday at midnight, beneath a bridge, at the third pillar on the west side.

But which bridge? The Arroyo Seco runs through multiple areas, crossed by numerous bridges.

We're checking them all.

## Connection to Other Signals

This is the third object we've found in three weeks. The mitten gave us a frequency. The wallet gave us a network diagram. The book gives us a meeting point.

These are not random. These are coordinated.

Someone—or some group—is using everyday lost objects as a distributed communication system. A network of signals hiding in plain sight, waiting for the curious, the attentive, the ones who stop and look closer.

## Status

**Active Investigation** - We're scouting bridges along the Arroyo Seco every Tuesday at midnight.

If you find a book on a bench, read what's been underlined.
