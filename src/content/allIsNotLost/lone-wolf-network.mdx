When someone connects to our WiFi network, they are automatically redirected to a custom splash page that presents the KDZU manifesto. There's no login form. No password. No data collection. Just a page. A signal.

## Demonstration

This is what can appear when you connect to an "All Is Not Lost" network:

It's fully responsive—working on phones, tablets, and laptops. After reading, visitors are left to decide what action to take next.

## What Is a Lone Wolf WiFi Network?

A **lone wolf WiFi network** is a small, self-contained wireless setup used to create a local network without internet access. This network does not uplink to social media. There is no ad tech. There is no cloud. It quietly shares local files or prompts, accessible only to those within WiFi range.

### No Internet Required

These "Lone Wolf" networks can run completely offline. The captive portal page is served directly from the router's internal storage or an attached USB drive. You don't need internet connectivity to transmit content, just a bit of power and physical proximity to the network.

### Human-Scale Distribution

We see these networks as similar to zines. A zine is photocopied and distributed by hand. A lone wolf network broadcasts at human scale, accessible only to those within physical proximity. The WiFi router becomes a "photocopier" for digital content—reproducing and distributing human-made content at human scale.

## How We Use Them

We place these routers in overlooked public spaces:

- **Trailheads** - Hidden near benches or information kiosks
- **Stairwells** - Tucked behind vending machines or fire extinguisher boxes
- **Rooftops** - Broadcasting from elevated positions
- **Gallery spaces** - Positioned as part of installations
- **Transit areas** - Anywhere people pause and pull out their phones

They run on batteries or tap into those strange, rare places with accessible power outlets (look behind vending machines!). These routers often disappear over time.


## What We Transmit

When someone connects, the captive portal can serve:

- **Messages or communiques** - Text-based transmissions
- **Audio streams** - Looping sound files or radio-style broadcasts
- **Tasks or requests** - Instructions for physical actions
- **Local file archives** - Documents, images, or PDFs stored on the router
- **Clues or coordinates** - Information leading to other locations or networks

The content is site-specific, temporary, and designed to reward curiosity.

## The Experience

You're walking through a park. On a bench, you notice a wallet sitting in plain sight. Most people would walk past.It is trash or it's someone else's problem. But something makes you stop. You pick it up.

It's empty. No ID. No cash. No cards. Just a folded piece of paper tucked into the billfold.

You unfold it. Hand-drawn symbols. A network name: **"All Is Not Lost."** Below it, simple instructions: *"Connect. Read. Act."*

You pull out your phone. You connect.

Your browser is immediately redirected. Not to a typical login page. Not asking for credentials. Instead you are given a task. A request. A transmission to consider.

You realize: the wallet was intentional. The network was intentional. Someone placed these here, waiting for someone like you—someone who stops, examines, opens, and follows mysterious signals.

The tactical artifact guided you. 

## Technical Implementation

Our implementation uses:

- **OpenWrt** - Open-source router firmware
- **openNDS** - Captive portal software
- **Custom ThemeSpec script** - Shell script generating the HTML page
- **Embedded assets** - All CSS, JavaScript, and content stored in the script

The complete technical setup and source code is available in our GitHub repository:

## Building Your Own

Want to create your own lone wolf network? Our [router setup guide](/all-is-not-lost/setting-up-a-router/) walks through the complete process:

1. Installing OpenWrt on a portable router
2. Configuring WiFi settings
3. Installing openNDS captive portal software
4. Deploying our custom theme
5. Customizing content for your project

The guide includes screenshots, troubleshooting tips, and technical details for adapting the system to your needs.
