When someone connects to our WiFi network, they are automatically redirected to a custom splash page that presents the KDZU manifesto. There's no login form. No password. No data collection. Just a page—dark, deliberate, and designed to feel like you've intercepted a signal.

## Watch the Experience

This is what appears when you connect to an "All Is Not Lost" network:

The page uses glitch effects, retro terminal styling, and a dark aesthetic. It's fully responsive—working on phones, tablets, and laptops. After reading, visitors click a single button to access the network.

## What Is a Lone Wolf WiFi Network?

A **lone wolf WiFi network** is a small, self-contained wireless setup used to create a local network without internet access. This network does not uplink to social media. There is no ad tech. There is no cloud. It quietly shares local files or prompts, accessible only to those within WiFi range.

### No Internet Required

These networks can run completely offline. The captive portal page is served directly from the router's internal storage or an attached USB drive. You don't need internet connectivity to transmit content—just power and physical proximity.

### Human-Scale Distribution

We see these networks as similar to zines. A zine is photocopied and distributed by hand. A lone wolf network broadcasts at human scale, accessible only to those within physical proximity. The WiFi router becomes a "photocopier" for digital content—reproducing and distributing human-made content at human scale.

## How We Use Them

We place these routers in overlooked public spaces:

- **Trailheads** - Hidden near benches or information kiosks
- **Stairwells** - Tucked behind vending machines or fire extinguisher boxes
- **Rooftops** - Broadcasting from elevated positions
- **Gallery spaces** - Positioned as part of installations
- **Transit areas** - Anywhere people pause and pull out their phones

They run on batteries or tap into those strange, rare places with accessible power outlets. These routers often disappear over time—which is part of their nature.

## What We Transmit

When someone connects, the captive portal can serve:

- **Messages or communiques** - Text-based transmissions
- **Audio streams** - Looping sound files or radio-style broadcasts
- **Tasks or requests** - Instructions for physical actions
- **Local file archives** - Documents, images, or PDFs stored on the router
- **Clues or coordinates** - Information leading to other locations or networks

The content is site-specific, temporary, and designed to reward curiosity.

## The Experience

You're walking. You see an unfamiliar WiFi network. Maybe the name catches your attention. Maybe you're bored and checking for open networks.

You connect.

Your browser is immediately redirected. Not to a typical login page asking for credentials or forcing you to watch ads. Instead, you land on a page that feels deliberate, strange, designed. There's text. Maybe audio playing. Instructions. A request. A transmission.

You realize someone placed this here intentionally. Someone wanted you to find it. The signal reached you.

## Technical Implementation

Our implementation uses:

- **OpenWrt** - Open-source router firmware
- **openNDS** - Captive portal software
- **Custom ThemeSpec script** - Shell script generating the HTML page
- **Embedded assets** - All CSS, JavaScript, and content stored in the script

The complete technical setup and source code is available in our GitHub repository:

## Philosophy: Routers as Transmitters

This is not a server in a data center. This is not cloud infrastructure. This is a router in a backpack, a transmitter on a rooftop, a signal in the stairwell—human-made content at human scale.

The ephemeral nature of these networks mirrors our project's themes of memory, silence, and artifacts. They appear. They broadcast. They disappear. What remains is the memory of the encounter—the moment you connected and realized something was being transmitted just for those who took notice.

## Building Your Own

Want to create your own lone wolf network? Our [router setup guide](/all-is-not-lost/setting-up-a-router/) walks through the complete process:

1. Installing OpenWrt on a portable router
2. Configuring WiFi settings
3. Installing openNDS captive portal software
4. Deploying our custom theme
5. Customizing content for your project

The guide includes screenshots, troubleshooting tips, and technical details for adapting the system to your needs.

**Every location where our focus wanders is a silent frequency awaiting transmission.**
