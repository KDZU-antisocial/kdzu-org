# First Blog Post

Welcome to our blog! This is the first post where we'll be sharing our thoughts and experiences.

## Example Photo with Caption

<PhotoWithCaption 
  src="https://picsum.photos/800/600" 
  alt="A beautiful landscape" 
  caption="This is an example photo with a caption. You can use any image URL here."
/>

## Example Photo Grid

<PhotoGrid 
  photos={[
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=1", 
      alt: "First grid photo",
      caption: "First photo in the grid"
    },
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=2", 
      alt: "Second grid photo",
      caption: "Second photo in the grid"
    },
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=3", 
      alt: "Third grid photo",
      caption: "Third photo in the grid"
    },
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=4", 
      alt: "Fourth grid photo",
      caption: "Fourth photo in the grid"
    }
  ]}
  columns={2}
/>

## Three Column Grid Example

<PhotoGrid 
  photos={[
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/300/200?random=5", 
      alt: "Three column photo 1"
    },
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/300/200?random=6", 
      alt: "Three column photo 2"
    },
    { 
      src: "https://picsum.photos/300/200?random=7", 
      alt: "Three column photo 3"
    }
  ]}
  columns={3}
/>

## Regular Markdown Content

You can still use regular markdown content alongside your components:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists like this one
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And more!

### Code blocks

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

This is a great way to create rich, interactive blog posts with beautiful photo layouts!
