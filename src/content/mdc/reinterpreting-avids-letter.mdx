title: 'Reinterpreting Our Letter from Avid'
description: "We spent many weeks trying to match Avid's drawing to one of our maps with no success.
              So, we tried switching to a digital map with satellite imagery and got a match!"

For days we tried placing Avid’s drawing "map" on top of our map of Southern California to see if we could get a match. 
Nothing. Then we tried Google Earth and scanned along every Southern California waterway we could find.

❌ Pacific Ocean
❌ Los Angeles River
❌ California Aqueduct
❌ Salton Sea
❌ San Diego River
❌ Santa Ana River
❌ Santa Clara River

And then we decided we would try some of the more "minor" waterways in Southern California.
But instinct, I think becuase of OMSA [Our Magical Sandy Arroyos] affinity for the NASA JPL
we decided to try the Arroyo Seco first. And, holy crap, we got a match!

## Power Lines "Cut Him in Half"

If you look carefully at the satellite image you can

           We have added blue circles to highlight the location of power poles that are placed in the Arroyo at this location.
            The white line is the power lines supported by the poles."

Avid's line drawn to bisect the wasp and their use of the Orwell quote 'A wasp was sucking jam on my plate 
and I cut him in half.' is telling us something about the signifance of the power lines.

It's time to bike to the Arroyo Seco.
