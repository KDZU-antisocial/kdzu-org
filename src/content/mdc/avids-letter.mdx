title: 'Interpreting Our Letter from Avid'
description: 'After the phone call, we received a letter from Avid at our KDZU Sonic Exoskeleton location in 
              Goldfield, Nevada. The letter is a folded, worn, and slightly water-damaged paper note with a 
              collection of esoteric symbols written in ballpoint pen.'

We spent quite a few hours working to decipher the letter at our weekly radio station meetings and drew 
a couple of conclusions.

<em>NOTE:</em> To ensure the confidentiality of Avid Listener, we will not post the original letter on our website. However, we 
will attempt to create a replica of it, so you can understand our process better.

We realized this letter is something that has been carried around in a pocket for a long time, longer than the time it 
took for Avid to contact us and then mail us a letter. Perhaps it has been in Avid’s pocket, or someone else’s pocket, 
for months or years? One of our KDZU DJs is an avid cyclist and helped us draw this conclusion. He noted that the 
notetaking journal he keeps in his back pocket experiences the same dampness and wear and tear when cycling in Southern 
California's summertime. The sweat from the body doesn’t soak the paper, but it gently permeates it, causing the edges 
to wear. That is one mystery about the letter, possibly or possibly not at all solved. Great.

## Is This a Map?
Avid’s writing in the letter felt completely esoteric until we finally realized we could be looking at a very clever 
map that is <em>not meant to resemble a map</em>, drawn by a system-impacted person who is not allowed to create, 
share, or mail maps to anyone.

Avid’s letter is relatively small and very sparse, making it difficult to interpret. We decided that if Avid’s letter 
is actually a map, we could overlay it on one of our current maps of the Los Angeles area to identify possible visual 
correlations. Our goal was to match the features of their hand-drawn, psychogeographic map with a modern, 
high-resolution, corporate-made map, allowing us to align the two and interpret any symbols or markers that might 
correspond to real places we could travel to.

What I am describing here is the map-to-map version of the “photo-to-terrain registration" technique, also known as 
“photogrammetric skyline matching,” which is used to determine the position or orientation of a photograph by aligning 
a skyline in the photo with an actual skyline on the ground. We thought, “Why not do this with a hand-drawn map 
overlaid on a real map?” I suppose this is a type of analog image registration, similar to GIS but with pieces of 
paper. Anyway, we placed Avid’s map on top of our current detailed map and moved it around, <em>for days</em> like a 
Midwestern family obsessed with completing a 1000-piece holiday jigsaw puzzle, hoping to find a match. 

## This Is Not a Map.
We scooted Avid's scrap of paper around on top of our map for days, but we didn’t find any matches... 

## Oh Yes It Is.
...until we changed our map to one from the 1990s.
