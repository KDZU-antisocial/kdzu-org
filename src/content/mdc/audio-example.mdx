# Audio Player Component Example

This post shows how to use the AudioPlayer component in your MDX content. You can embed audio files with various customizations.

## Audio with Cover Art

Here's an audio player with album cover:

<AudioPlayer 
  src="https://examplefiles.org/files/audio/mp3-example-file-download-1min.mp3"
  title="Sample Music Track"
  artist="Demo Artist"
  album="Test Album"
  coverArt="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519692933481-e162a57d6721?w=300&h=300&fit=crop"
  controls={true}
  volume={1}
/>

## Custom Controls

Audio player with custom controls (no native browser controls):

<AudioPlayer 
  src="https://examplefiles.org/files/audio/mp3-example-file-download-1min.mp3"
  controls={false}
  title="Custom Controls Demo"
  artist="Test Artist"
  album="Custom Controls Album"
  coverArt="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493225457124-a3eb161ffa5f?w=300&h=300&fit=crop"
  volume={1}
/>

## Native Controls Test

Testing with native browser controls to isolate custom control issues:

<AudioPlayer 
  src="https://examplefiles.org/files/audio/mp3-example-file-download-1min.mp3"
  title="Native Controls Test"
  artist="Test Artist"
  controls={true}
  volume={1}
  preload="auto"
/>

## Usage in Content

You can place audio players anywhere in your content, and they'll be responsive and properly styled. The component automatically handles:

- Responsive design
- Accessibility features
- Custom styling options
- Performance optimization
- Volume control
- Progress tracking

The audio players will work seamlessly with your existing content and styling, perfect for music posts, podcast episodes, or any audio content you want to share.

## Technical Notes

These examples use sample audio files from a GitHub repository. In production, you would:

1. Upload your audio files to your R2 bucket
2. Use URLs like `https://static.kdzu.org/audio/your-file.mp3`
3. Ensure proper licensing for your audio content
4. Optimize file sizes for web delivery

The AudioPlayer component works with any audio file URL, whether it's hosted on your R2 bucket or elsewhere on the internet.

## Testing with Your Own Files

To test with your own audio files:

1. **Place an MP3 file** in `public/audio/` (e.g., `test.mp3`)
2. **Run your build script** to upload to R2
3. **Use the URL**: `https://static.kdzu.org/audio/test.mp3`

Example:
```mdx
<AudioPlayer 
  src="https://static.kdzu.org/audio/test.mp3"
  title="My Test Track"
  artist="My Artist"
  controls={true}
  volume={1}
/>
```

This will give you a working audio player with your own content!
