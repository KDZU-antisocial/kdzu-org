We spent many hours acclimating to the Arroyo wash area and left completely confounded and sunburned. Everything 
just looked like an unremarkable rock or an unremarkable log. This makes everything look like a <em>remarkable</em> rock
or a <em>remarkable</em> log! If nothing <em>looks</em> promising, perhaps everything <em>is</em> promising? But not today. 
The possibilities were just too endless.

## Day 2 Scouting: We Found an Exciting Location

We rode our bikes back to the Arroyo in the early evening of July 5th. We could hear the yelping of coyote pups down 
in the bottom of the wash as we approached Explorer Road. The reverbant sound of their yipping and singing was so eerie
and piercing. So we stopped our bikes to find them and, of course, they went completely silent. But we did 
eventually find them! Or... some of them! And we were totally captivated.

The coyotes silently nipped and tackled each other and rolled over on their backs for about ten minutes in front this 
beautiful clump of trees. They would stare at one of the coyotes and the coyote would come running to play. They then 
stared at us for a few minutes with their tails wagging. And then they bolted away. We had cataloged this strange clump 
of Fremont Cottonwoods before. In the video below you can see a blanket of light pink feathery seedlings dusting the 
ground in right of the frame. Was the playful stare of the coyotes an invitation to this clump of Cottonwoods?

            most likely spot for digging. Notice the small entryway-style row of rocks at the far center left of the
