After spending many hours acclimating to the Arroyo wash area we were completely confounded and sunburned. Everything 
just looked like an unremarkable rock or an unremarkable log. 

## Our Most Exciting Location

We rode our bikes back to the Arroyo on the late afternoon of July 5th. We could hear the yelping of coyote pups down 
in the bottom of the wash as we approached Explorer Road. The reverbant sound of their yipping and yelping was amazing
so we stopped to find them and of course they went completely silent. But we did them! And we were totally captivated.

            most likely spot for digging. Notice the small entryway-style row of rocks at the far center left of the 
            photo."
