KDZU's DJ Future Ghost invites participants to explore KDZU's underground operations, uncover the station's origins, and interpret its objectives as tactical mythmakers in a conversational behind-the-scenes discussion that highlights the KDZU creative ecosystem: the Dubplate Forensics Agent, the 'All Is Not Lost' WiFi network, and the station's ongoing zine-making experiments.
