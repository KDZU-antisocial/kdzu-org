In this first installment of KDZU's 'Static is the Structure,' DJ Future Ghost (Rob Ray) conjures the translucent pop and crackle of augmented-reality-enhanced dub techno, provoking the invisible that lingers between the atoms of The Reef, a mid-century industrial building in Los Angeles that is the creative home of CultureHub LA.
