During the residency, KDZU will also transmit through All Is Not Lost, KDZUâ€™s lone-wolf WiFi network that drifts through the building like a ghost frequency, carrying fragments of recordings, field notes, and transmissions from their ongoing investigations. You can learn more about our work to restore the roots and shoots of a rhizomatic underground  over on our <a href="https://kdzu.org/all-is-not-lost/">All Is Not Lost</a> project page.
