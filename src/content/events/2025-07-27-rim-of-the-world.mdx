KDZU is setting up a dance party and rogue micro-broadcast radio station perched just above the sonic wormhole at the Rim of the World. We will be broadcasting from our van and mobile radio rig powered by solar panels, salvaged gear, and fungal-root amplifiers. Come dance to pulsing electro, deep Detroit techno, Afrofuturist funk, and poetic ecological treatises. Freak to basslines from the broken earth and dispatches from futures no longer willing to wait for us.
