Powered by solar panels, salvaged tech, and fungal-root amplifiers, the mobile FM station transmits a mix of electro, Detroit techno, Afrofuturist funk, political manifestos, and ecological poetry. As cars pass through the signal zone, they can tune into voices from the wormhole—dispatches from alternate futures and Earth’s buried memory: part rave, part ritual, part warning.
