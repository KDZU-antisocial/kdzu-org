# Decoding OMSA: Analysis of the Memphis Pyramid Transmissions

*"The signal you are receiving is not what you think it is."*

This phrase, repeated across multiple OMSA broadcasts from 1991-1994, serves as both a warning and an invitation. Through our analysis of recently recovered transmission logs and field recordings, we're beginning to understand the sophisticated narrative sabotage techniques employed by the Obsolete Monuments Space Agency during their Memphis Pyramid occupation.

## The Transmission Pattern

Our analysis reveals a complex, multi-layered approach to radio broadcasting that went far beyond simple music programming. OMSA's transmissions followed a distinctive pattern:

### Phase 1: Establishment (1991-1992)
- **Frequency**: 89.7 MHz (unofficial, unlicensed)
- **Schedule**: Irregular, often during solar events or geomagnetic storms
- **Content**: Mix of experimental music, field recordings, and scientific data

### Phase 2: Escalation (1992-1993)
- **Frequency**: Multiple frequencies simultaneously
- **Schedule**: Daily broadcasts during specific astronomical events
- **Content**: Introduction of "false weather reports" and "alternate timeline" narratives

### Phase 3: Sabotage (1993-1994)
- **Frequency**: Frequency-hopping to avoid detection
- **Schedule**: 24/7 continuous transmission
- **Content**: Full narrative disruption and fourth-wall breaking

## Key Transmission Types

### 1. Weather Reports from Alternate Timelines

```
TRANSMISSION LOG #OMSA-1993-047
DATE: March 15, 1993
TIME: 03:47 UTC
FREQUENCY: 89.7 MHz

"Good morning, Memphis. This is your weather report for March 15, 1993. 
Current conditions: 72°F with 89% humidity. 
Expected high: 78°F. 
Expected low: 65°F. 
Chance of precipitation: 0%. 
Chance of temporal anomalies: 47%. 
Chance of narrative disruption: 100%. 
This has been your weather report from Timeline Beta-7. 
Stay tuned for more from the Memphis Pyramid."
```

### 2. Mississippi River Field Recordings

The group regularly broadcast field recordings from the Mississippi River, but with subtle manipulations:

- **Speed variations**: Some recordings played at 0.75x or 1.25x normal speed
- **Layered audio**: River sounds mixed with distant radio transmissions
- **Temporal markers**: Audio cues that suggested different time periods

### 3. Scientific Data Poetry

OMSA developed a unique form of "scientific poetry" where they would:

```python
# Example of OMSA's "data poetry" technique
def create_scientific_poem(data_stream):
    poem = []
    for data_point in data_stream:
        if data_point.value > threshold:
            poem.append(f"The river flows at {data_point.value} cubic feet per second")
            poem.append(f"While we broadcast at {data_point.frequency} MHz")
            poem.append(f"Creating interference patterns in the electromagnetic spectrum")
    return "\n".join(poem)
```

## The RAD Methodology

OMSA's Research, Artmaking, and Development (RAD) approach involved:

### Research Phase
- **Signal analysis** of commercial radio stations
- **Audience behavior** studies through transmission feedback
- **Temporal mapping** of broadcast patterns

### Artmaking Phase
- **Content creation** using found materials and field recordings
- **Narrative construction** that deliberately broke conventional storytelling
- **Audience engagement** through participatory elements

### Development Phase
- **Technique refinement** based on listener responses
- **Technology advancement** through homemade broadcasting equipment
- **Methodology documentation** for future practitioners

## Technical Analysis

### Broadcasting Equipment

Based on recovered schematics and eyewitness accounts, OMSA used:

- **Custom-built transmitters** with variable frequency output
- **Modified consumer electronics** for signal processing
- **Homemade antennas** positioned throughout the Pyramid
- **Battery backup systems** for continuous operation

### Signal Characteristics

```
FREQUENCY RANGE: 88.1 - 91.3 MHz
POWER OUTPUT: 50-100 watts (variable)
MODULATION: FM with amplitude variations
BANDWIDTH: 200 kHz (expanded from standard 150 kHz)
```

## The Great Raid and Aftermath

The 1994 "Great Raid" on the Memphis Pyramid marked the end of OMSA's broadcasting operations, but not their influence. Analysis of post-1994 transmissions reveals:

- **Signal persistence**: Some frequencies continued broadcasting for weeks after the raid
- **Geographic dispersal**: Similar transmission patterns appeared in other cities
- **Temporal echoes**: Recordings of OMSA broadcasts were found in unexpected locations

## Contemporary Relevance

OMSA's techniques remain relevant today for several reasons:

### 1. Algorithmic Resistance
Their frequency-hopping and signal disruption techniques parallel modern strategies for avoiding algorithmic detection and censorship.

### 2. Narrative Sabotage
The group's approach to breaking conventional storytelling patterns provides a model for contemporary media resistance.

### 3. Community Building
OMSA's use of radio as a tool for community organization and resistance offers lessons for modern activists.

## Reconstruction Efforts

KDZU's current work involves:

- **Signal reconstruction** using modern digital tools
- **Pattern analysis** of transmission logs and recordings
- **Technique documentation** for contemporary practitioners
- **Equipment replication** using modern components

## The Legacy Continues

OMSA's work demonstrates that narrative sabotage isn't just about disrupting stories—it's about creating new possibilities for communication, community, and resistance. Their transmissions from the Memphis Pyramid continue to inspire and inform our work at KDZU.

*"The static between stations isn't just noise—it's the sound of possibility."*
