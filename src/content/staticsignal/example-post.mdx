# Example Static Post

This is an example post to test the new static collection with MDX support.

## Features

The static collection now supports:

- **MDX content** - Full Markdown with JSX components
- **Hero images** - Optional featured images
- **Tags** - Categorization system
- **Publication dates** - Chronological ordering
- **Descriptions** - Meta descriptions for SEO

## Code Example

```javascript
// You can include code blocks
const example = "This is a code example";
console.log(example);
```

## Links

You can include [links](https://kdzu.org) and other Markdown features.

## Images

You can also include images directly in the MDX content:

This post demonstrates that the static collection is now working with MDX files just like the MDC section!
