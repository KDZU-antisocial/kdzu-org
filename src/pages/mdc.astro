        <h2>Our Phone Call from "Avid Listener"</h2>
        <p>In March of 2025, we received a phone call on the KDZU Red Phone from a person identifying themselves only 
          as “Avid Listener,” sharing details about some OMSA [Outlaw Mechanics Sabotaging the Afterlife] members who had 
          resided in the Southern California area in the 1990s. By itself, this information isn’t news to us. We knew 
          members spread out pretty far after the Great Raid on the Memphis Pyramid in 1994. There are little bits of 
          written evidence and word-of-mouth tales that members of the group scattered to St. Louis, Minneapolis, Baton 
          Rouge, and out west to Tucson, Denver, and Goldfield, Nevada. So… Los Angeles does not seem very far-fetched. 
          But there wasn’t, to our knowledge, any existing evidence of OMSA [Our Memory Survives in the Aether] 
          <em>missions</em> that happened in Southern California. That is, until Avid shared bits of an actual mission 
          in the Los Angeles area. Yes, <em>in Los Angeles</em>, where we have a station!
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is a summary of what Avid described as the mission. Avid is incarcerated, so our phone call was 
          interrupted <em>multiple times</em> by the prison's automated collect call interruptor. But we will do our 
          best to glue together all the moments of our conversation here.
        </p> 
          
        <h3>The NASA JPL "Rocky" Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            Avid said that a group of OMSA [Our Manifestos Survive in Arroyos] members, who lived in the Pyramid, had 
            long been intrigued by NASA JPL’s “Rocky” series of robotics projects, which were developed in the late 
            1980s and early 1990s. Based on our research about the collective’s RAD (Research, Artmaking and 
            Development) happening in the Pyramid, this seems plausible. The group had been interested in JPL’s orbiter 
            and lander work. It seems reasonable that some RAD on rovers and terrestrial robotics would be in that same 
            set of enthusiasms and tasks. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <em>Note:</em> In the small pieces of writing we have read, authored by group members, we noticed that the phases of 
            research and development were consistently referred to as “RAD,” short for Research, Artmaking, and 
            Development. We will use their terminology here to describe their working methods. Our use of “RAD” is 
            intended to be respectful of the group’s word choices and also to provide more accurate descriptions of 
            their processes.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Research, Artmaking, and Development with a Nearby Waterway</h3>
          <p>
            Avid Listener also mentioned, with some repeated statements, that the group was particularly interested in 
            establishing research outposts at sites that felt harmonious with the working environment of the Memphis 
            Pyramid and the nearby Mississippi River. The Pyramid served as their architectural epicenter for 
            scientific research, artmaking, and engineering development. The nearby Mississippi River waterway was 
            important to the group both culturally and practically, serving as a venue for recreation, field testing, 
            and transportation. Avid’s details about this currently seem anomalous, unless perhaps there’s something 
            we should consider about the Pacific Ocean, the Los Angeles River, the California Aqueduct, or some other 
            Southern Californian waterway. This could have simply been Avid repeating themselves due to the constant 
            interruptions from the prison’s collect call system. We don’t know. But for now, we consider Avid’s reasons 
            sound, if also elusive and inconclusive.
          </p>
          
          <h3>"I'll get you something."</h3>
          <p>
            Avid left our conversation with a brief statement of appreciation for our work, a statement of solidarity, 
            and a vague “I’ll get you something.” We didn’t understand what this last part meant until a couple of 
            weeks ago, when we received a letter in the mail from Avid sent to our KDZU Sonic Exoskeleton location in 
            Goldfield, Nevada.

            We are now neck deep in this project (are we, though?), so we decided to create separate posts here, 
            journaling our activities.
