          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>KDZU is an underground radio station that exists to share the excitements of music and powers of creativity with other people. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not recognize KDZU as a real station. But if there is a mixer, DJs, human connection, and maybe even catharsis, is that not real?</p>
          
          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Founded in 2023, KDZU emerged from a desire to create a space where music and creativity could flow freely, unconstrained by traditional broadcasting rules. We believe in the power of community, the magic of music, and the importance of preserving underground culture.</p>
          
          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>We curate and share music that pushes boundaries, tell stories through sound, and create connections between artists and listeners. Our programming includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Live DJ sets and mixes</li>
            <li>Artist interviews and features</li>
            <li>Music discovery and recommendations</li>
            <li>Community events and collaborations</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Join Us</h2>
          <p>Whether you're an artist, a music lover, or just curious about underground radio, there's a place for you in the KDZU community. Follow us on social media, tune in to our broadcasts, or reach out to get involved.</p>
